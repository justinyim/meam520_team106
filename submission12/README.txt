Our project is an animation, therefore our submission is slightly different
than a standard light painting submission.

File Descriptions
----------

team106_choose_solution.m
    standard choose solution function
    
team106_distanceMetric_l2norm.m
    distance metric used by choose_solution

team106_distanceMetric_linfinitynorm.m
    distance metric used by choose_solution

team106_sanitize_outputs.m
    used by choose_solution to eliminate out-of-joint-range solutions

team106_get_poc.m
    standard get_poc, loads team106.mat
    
team106_test_painting.m
    The project document says not to submit this, but we made some
    modifications that make it easier to review our work:
    - We made the animation generally faster
    - We dropped the interpolation resolution to make it faster
    - We don't clear all to avoid reloading our information for each frame

team106_puma_paint.m
    We again made some modifications:
    - We don't clear all to avoid reloading our information for each frame

team106_generate_puma_frames.m
    This file is the framework by which our work can be tested.  
    
    This script
    (a) generates a 4D cube
    (b) applies a 4D rotation
    (c) projects the 4D cube into 3D with a skewed perspective projection
    (d) applies a 3D rotation
    (e) generates a .mat file which can be fed to the puma
    (f) tests the .mat file (CHOOSE _test_painting OR _puma_paint on line 44)
    (g) takes a picture of the final result
    
    (h) repeats (a) through (g) for multiple frames
    (i) forms the frames into a .avi movie which can be used to view the
        animation

team106_xx.mat
    These are the individual frames in our animation

team106.mat
    This is only generated so that _test_painting and _puma_paint work; it
    is regularly overwritten and changes based on what frame was last
    generated by _generate_puma_frames

    This will not exist until you run team106_generate_puma_frames.m

prelim_vid_puma_paint.avi
    Animation generated by _puma_paint

prelim_vid_test_painting.avi
    Animation generated by _test_painting


----------
How to Run
----------

(1) open team106_generate_puma_frames.m
(2) optionally change line 44/45 to use team106_test_painting or team106_puma_paint
(3) run via F5 or equivalent
(4) enjoy
